# us-states-game

This was written as part of a Python course as an exercise
in using Pandas. The .csv and image files were provided by the 
course. A map of the United States will display. The user tries
to fill in all 50 State's names. If the player quits before 
guessing all 50 (clicks the Cancel button), write the missed 
states names to a .csv file.
